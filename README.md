# Overview

For this project I was attempting to complete a note-taking program in Kotlin
There is no user interface because the goal of the project was to practice
Kotlin. The program presents the user with menu options. The user will enter the
option they want and the program will either prompt the user for a note to input,
a note to delete, or will simply print the notes to the terminal.

# Development Environment
I used Kotlin as the language to write this program and IntelliJ as the editor.
I originally used the scanner library but changed to a simple readline command 
to use user input in the program.

# Future Work

- One major change I could make would be to add a user interface to the program.
- The second change I could make would to split everything into classes and clean up the code
- The third change I could make would be to store the list of notes in a text document.
